These are some tasks that need to be done to improve the Color Shooter game. 
They are listed in increasing order of complexity. If none of these appeals to you, 
feel free to make other improvements!

1. The explosion that happens when a target is successfully hit is currently white. It 
  would be cooler if the targets exploded in their own color. Change the code so that 
  this is the case:
  - Find where the explosion is created in the `calculate_collisions` method. 
  - The ExplosionMaker class takes an extra argument to its constructor called `color`.
    Pass in the color of the target that was hit. 

2. Our game is pretty silent right now. Let's add some sound effects!
  - We'll take them from the media that comes packaged with the arade library. 
    Add these two lines to the GameView constructor: 
      self.laser_sound = arcade.load_sound(":resources:sounds/hurt5.wav")
      self.hit_sound = arcade.load_sound(":resources:sounds/explosion1.wav")
  - When the player shoots a laser, play the laser sound by calling `arcade.play_sound(<sound_to_play>)` 
  - Similarly, when a target is successfully hit, play the hit sound.

3. The game score does not work right now. To fix this, complete the following steps:
  - Whenever a target is hit with a laser of the correct color, increment the score.
    Use the member variable `self.score`, which has already been initialized for you.
    Look in the function called `calculate_collisions` to get started.
  - Next, draw the score on the screen. Uncomment the line in the `on_draw` function
    that starts with `arcade.draw_text(...)`. Edit the score text to reflect the score 
    you just updated.
  - The score is currently drawn in the center of the screen. Move it so that it is drawn
    in the top right corner instead. You should be able to use the SCREEN_WIDTH and SCREEN_HEIGHT
    constants to do this.
  - For an extra challenge, try one or both of the following:
      - Change the scoring mechanism so that the player gets a lot of points for a close color
        match, and not as many for a worse match. You may have to add some utility functions to
        determine how close a match is (put these in the `utils.py` file).
      - Update the scoring mechanism so that a player loses points if they hit a target
        with a laser that is not a match.

4. Lastly, the projectiles that the ship shoots are called "lasers", but they're circular and don't
  look too much like lasers. We can change that by changing the shader that's used to draw
  them:
  - In the `__init__` method of the GameView class, create a new shadertoy just like the one 
  created from "glow_ball.glsl", but this time use the file "glow_line.glsl".
  - At the top of the file, import the `GlowLine` class from the `glow_line` file.
  - In the `fire_projectile` method, change `laser_sprite` to be an instance of the newly
  imported `GlowLine` class instead of `GlowBall`. Make sure to use your new shadertoy!
  - Our laser looks pretty spindly right now. Let's edit the shader file to make it a little
  more impressive. Open `glow_line.glsl` and read the comments there (look for "START HERE!")
  and make it more glowy/thicker.
